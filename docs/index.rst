GLDAS Data Tool
===============
The GLDAS Data Tool is a tool to facilitate downloading, visualizing, processing, analyzing, and sharing GLDAS v2.X
data from NASA. GLDAS, Global Land Data Assimilation System, is a historical earth observation dataset based on the
LIS, Land Information System, land-surface model.

The tool is a Tethys application with scripts for automated install and data downloads, several tools for data
visualization through maps and charts, and a REST API for programmatic access to the data. Tethys Platform is an
open-source software developed at Brigham Young University in the Hydroinformatics Lab. Tethys makes it easier to
develop and deploy web-apps for scientific data, especially geospatial and water resources related datasets.
`Read the Documentation for Tethys <http://docs.tethysplatform.org/en/stable/>`_ and visit the
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/tethysplatform/tethys>`_.
